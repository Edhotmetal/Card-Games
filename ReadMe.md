# Card Games!

## Disclaimer!

card.rb, deck.rb, hand.rb, and high_low.rb are NOT my own creations!
I merely translated them from Java into Ruby
The original Java files and much, much more can be found at math.hws.edu/javanotes/index.html

### display_card.rb

I did write this one!

This script uses the Qt framework to display a shuffled 54 card deck in columns of five cards.
It doesn't do anything else.

It contains the CardWidget class which extends Widget
